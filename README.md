# lstm-load-forecasting
Ongoing research in Machine Learning.  Time series forecasting of energy consumption on residential level using data from previous time steps.  Novel deep learning models implemented.

This repository aims to reproduce the results of the paper "Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting based on LSTM Recurrent Neural Network" (2017) by Weicong Kong et al. using TensorFlow.
It also tries to build upon the project by trying to project multiple time steps ahead and comparing different architectures.
